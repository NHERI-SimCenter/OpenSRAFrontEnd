# OpenSRAFrontEnd
This repository contains the source code to build the UI for [OpenSRA](https://github.com/bzheng10/OpenSRA_dev). Users will need to install Qt5 and QtCreator to build the program. This project also requires the following repositories from the NHERI-SimCenter:

1. [R2DTool](https://github.com/bzheng10/R2DTool)
2. [SimCenterCommon](https://github.com/bzheng10/SimCenterCommon)
3. [QGISPlugin](https://github.com/bzheng10/QGISPlugin)

Before building, please go into the OpenSRA.pro and update the path to each of the 4 repositories.
