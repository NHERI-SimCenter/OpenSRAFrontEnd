Install on Windows 10
=====================


Download the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To download the |app|, navigate to the `OpenSRA Download <www.google.ca>`_ page which should resemble :numref:`figDownloadWin-OpenSRA`. The download page contains a list of downloadable files and directories.

      OpenSRA download page.


Click on the link ##### to download the |app|. After the download completed, run the installer to install to a location in your filesystem. We suggest keeping the default installation locations. A shortcut that points to the |short tool id|.exe executable of the application will be created on your Desktop for easy access.


Test the Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the installation procedure has been completed, it is a good practice to run some basic checks. Navigate to your desktop and run OpenSRA by double-clicking on the link.

.. note::

   Since OpenSRA is not registered as a Windows vendor, our apps are not recognized by the operating system as signed applications. You may receive a warning message that lets you know about risks involved in running unsigned applications from unkown sources when you start the |short tool name| application for the first time. It is safe to bypass that warning when running SimCenter applications.
